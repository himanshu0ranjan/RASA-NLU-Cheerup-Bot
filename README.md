The bot will ask you how you’re doing, and send a picture to try and cheer you up if you are sad.

This comes with a small amount of training data which lets you build a simple assistant.

## Setup and installation

If you haven’t installed Rasa NLU and Rasa Core yet, you can do it by navigating to the project directory and running:  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You also need to install a spaCy English language model. You can install it by running:

```
python -m spacy download en
```

### Files for training the Rasa NLU model

- **data/nlu_data.json** file contains training examples of six intents: 
	- greet
	- goodbye
	- thanks
	- deny
	- joke
	- name (examples of this intent contain an entity called 'name')
	
- **nlu_config.yml** file contains the configuration of the Rasa NLU pipeline:  
```text
language: "en"

pipeline: spacy_sklearn
```	

### Files for training the Rasa Core model

- **data/stories.md** file contains some training stories which represent the conversations between a user and the assistant. 
- **domain.yml** file describes the domain of the assistant which includes intents, entities, slots, templates and actions the assistant should be aware of.  
- **actions.py** file contains the code of a custom action which retrieves a Chuck Norris joke by making an external API call.
- **endpoints.yml** file contains the webhook configuration for custom action.
